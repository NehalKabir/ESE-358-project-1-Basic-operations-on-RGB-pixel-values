# ESE-358-project-1-Basic-operations-on-RGB-pixel-values
Tasks given
1.	Read an RGB image (8 bits/pixel) in jpeg format. Call this image A. The size of A should be 512x512. Display image A at runtime.
2.  Read an RGB image (8 bits/pixel) in jpeg format. Call this image A. The size of A should be 512x512. Display image A at runtime.
3.  Compute the gray-eve; image AG of A.
4.  Compute the histograms of the images RC,GC,BC, and AG, and display the histogram at runtime
5.  Binarizing the image: Threshold the image AG to obtain a binary image AB. To do this, prompt the user to enter a threshold brightness TB as input at runtime (e.g. TB=100). Binarizing the image: Threshold the image AG to obtain a binary image AB. To do this, prompt the user to enter a threshold brightness TB as input at runtime (e.g. TB=100).
6.  Simple edge detection: Derive the edge image AE of AG.
7.  Create an image pyramid
